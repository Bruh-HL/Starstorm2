![New Survivors...](https://github.com/swuff-star/Starstorm2/blob/main/SS2-Project/Assets/Starstorm2/ReadmeAssets/ss2survivorpromo.gif?raw=true)

* **Executioner**  - An aggressive, versatile survivor with an arsenal made for picking off targets and chaining kills. His powerful Ion Manipulators gain charges with every kill.

* **???** - Survivors of unknown origin, familiar yet unfamiliar. Under the right conditions, you may meet them on the Planet, but they certainly won't be on your side.

* **New Items & Equipment** - A plethora of new items and equipment to support new and existing playstyles. Watch your six with an Armed Backpack, rush through teleporter events with a Field Accelerator, all while keeping on the move with a Swift Skateboard - and more!

* **New Interactables** - New drones, paired with the Refabricator, come in handy to assist you while you fight for survival.

![New Challenges...](https://github.com/swuff-star/Starstorm2/blob/main/SS2-Project/Assets/Starstorm2/ReadmeAssets/ss2challengepromo.gif?raw=true)

* **Events** - Between severe weather, magical buildups, and mysterious invaders, learn to expect the unexpected as forces both natural and supernatural interfere with your runs.

* **New Monsters** - New species of the Planet have come out to put a stop to your invasion of their home.

* **Typhoon** - The Planet grows restless, with fearsome events and monsters coming in greater numbers than ever before. Unlock new skins for survivors* by proving yourself in this new challenge exceeding even Monsoon!
	 *currently includes Commando, Huntress, MUL-T, Acrid, Captain, Executioner, and Commando's Vestige.
